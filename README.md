In this paper, we first define three different levels of representativeness, and open up a window for addressing step by step the issue of representativeness-measuring. Then we turn to address the Type-III representativeness-measuring problem, and provide a metric for this problem. To illustrate how to use the proposed metric, the representativeness-measuring problem of benchmark problems for single-objective unconstrained continuous optimization is examined. The analysis covers as many as 1141 single-objective unconstrained continuous benchmark problems, primarily focusing on existing benchmark problems. Based on the defined representativeness metric, some classical features and calculations are used to assess the representativeness of the benchmark problems.
